Let’s map your environment:

 ✔ You are inside a Docker container
 ✔ The internal network is `172.18.0.0/16`
 ✔ There are multiple internal services:
- Web app → `172.18.0.2`
- PostgreSQL → `172.18.0.3`
- Possibly more containers

✔ You want to explore the internal network
✔ You want to understand how services relate to the host

**Ligolo-ng is the better fit**
because your goal is **network exploration**, not just tunneling a single port.
