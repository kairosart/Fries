Use a tool that creates a `tunnel` or a `proxy/VPN` to the victim server to work externally as if we were on the internal local network.

## Sshuttle

*sshuttle is a tool that creates a VPN‑like connection over SSH, letting your machine route traffic into a remote network as if you were physically inside it. It works without special server configuration and behaves like a “transparent proxy meets VPN,” which makes it useful when you can SSH into a host but need broader network access.

### Installing

```
sudo apt install sshuttle
```

### Running

Credentials: `svc::Friesf00Ds2025!!`

```
sudo sshuttle -r svc@<MACHINE IP> -N
```

The connection is *tunneled*.
