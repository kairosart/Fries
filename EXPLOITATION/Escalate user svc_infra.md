## Showmount
`showmount` is a Linux command that queries an NFS (Network File System) server and displays which directories it is exporting and which clients are connected to it.  It’s a diagnostic/visibility tool — it does _not_ mount anything by itself.

## Share folders
Run:

```
showmount -e localhost
```

![[showmount.png]]

You see which folders the server is sharing over NFS.

## Lists clients connected to the server

Running `showmount` with no options shows which machines have mounted exports from that server.

```
showmount
```

## List file on /srv/web.fries.htb

You can mount anything inside this folder, and coincidentally, there is a folder, *shared*,  with all permissions:

```
ls -la /srv/web.fries.htb
```
