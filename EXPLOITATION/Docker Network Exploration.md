You are on meterpreter session, so, you have to get a shell .

#meterpreter 

```
meterpreter > shell
```

## Improving the shell

To have all the tools of authentic shell, run:

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm
cd /tmp
```

## Container environment

Docker containers commonly store configuration values — including service settings, ports, and sometimes credentials — in **environment variables**. This is standard practice in development environments.

If you have a shell _inside_ a container, you can usually inspect the environment the same way you would in any isolated Linux process.

#container_shell

```
printenv
```

## What Your `printenv` Output Tells You

Here’s the key information embedded in those variables:

**1. You’re definitely inside the pgAdmin Docker container**

The presence of:

- `PGAPPNAME=pgAdmin 4`
    
- `CONFIG_DISTRO_FILE_PATH=/pgadmin4/config_distro.py`
    
- `HOME=/home/pgadmin`
    
- `PYTHONPATH=/pgadmin4`
    

…confirms you’re inside the pgAdmin service container, not the host.

### **2. The container was started with default pgAdmin credentials**

These two variables are the important ones:

- `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@fries.htb`
    
- `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=Friesf00Ds2025!!`
    

This is exactly how pgAdmin is configured in Docker deployments: the credentials are passed in as environment variables at container startup.

This is a deliberate misconfiguration the machine wants you to recognize.

### **3. The next step is** _**not**_ **inside the container**

This is the key conceptual insight:

> **Environment variables inside a container tell you how the service is configured.** **The intended next step is to use that configuration information** _**outside**_ **the container.**

In other words, pgAdmin is running as a web service somewhere on the machine. The container’s environment variables tell you how to authenticate to it.

That’s the pivot the machine is teaching.

## What You Should Be Thinking About Now (High‑Level Only)

Here’s the mindset to adopt:

- You now know the pgAdmin login credentials.
    
- pgAdmin is a web interface.
    
- The container is not the final destination.
    
- The machine expects you to use the service the container is running.
    

This is a classic HTB pattern:

> **Container → Misconfigured secrets → Access to internal service → Next stage**

You’ve just completed the “misconfigured secrets” part.
